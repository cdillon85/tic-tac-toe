This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and is based off the [tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html#setup-for-the-tutorial) found in the react.js documentation. 

Some additional features added to this project include:

* Making the code more modular and breaking up components into separate files.
* Adding new components to make the game flow more interesting.
* Refactoring components to be functional components and using hooks for state manangement.
* Incorporating the Context API to allow the user to select a theme for the tic-tac-toe game.
* Switching styling to CSS-in-JS format using [emotion.js](https://emotion.sh/docs/introduction).
